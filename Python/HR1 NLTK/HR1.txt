    ratemaking purposes and reflecting operating results in its 
    regulated books of account, reduces the excess tax reserve more 
    rapidly or to a greater extent than such reserve would be reduced 
    under the average rate assumption method.

    first day of the taxable year that includes the date of enactment 
    of this Act--

        contain the vintage account data necessary to apply the average 
        rate assumption method,
    the taxpayer will be treated as using a normalization method of 
    accounting if, with respect to such jurisdiction, the taxpayer uses 
    the alternative method for public utility property that is subject 
    to the regulatory authority of that jurisdiction.
        (3) Definitions.--For purposes of this subsection--
            (A) Excess tax reserve.--The term ``excess tax reserve'' 
        means the excess of--
                (i) the reserve for deferred taxes (as described in 
            section 168(i)(9)(A)(ii) of the Internal Revenue Code of 
            1986) as of the day before the corporate rate reductions 
            provided in the amendments made by this section take 
            effect, over
                (ii) the amount which would be the balance in such 
            reserve if the amount of such reserve were determined by 
            assuming that the corporate rate reductions provided in 
            this Act were in effect for all prior periods.
            (B) Average rate assumption method.--The average rate 
        assumption method is the method under which the excess in the 
        reserve for deferred taxes is reduced over the remaining lives 
        of the property as used in its regulated books of account which 
        gave rise to the reserve for deferred taxes. Under such method, 
        during the time period in which the timing differences for the 
        property reverse, the amount of the adjustment to the reserve 
        for the deferred taxes is calculated by multiplying--
                (i) the ratio of the aggregate deferred taxes for the 
            property to the aggregate timing differences for the 
            property as of the beginning of the period in question, by
                (ii) the amount of the timing differences which reverse 
            during such period.
            (C) Alternative method.--The ``alternative method'' is the 
        method in which the taxpayer--
                (i) computes the excess tax reserve on all public 
            utility property included in the plant account on the basis 
            of the weighted average life or composite rate used to 
            compute depreciation for regulatory purposes, and
                (ii) reduces the excess tax reserve ratably over the 
            remaining regulatory life of the property.
        (4) Tax increased for normalization violation.--If, for any 
    taxable year ending after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
    the taxpayer does not use a normalization method of accounting for 
    the corporate rate reductions provided in the amendments made by 
    this section--
            (A) the taxpayer's tax for the taxable year shall be 
        increased by the amount by which it reduces its excess tax 
        reserve more rapidly than permitted under a normalization 
        method of accounting, and
            (B) such taxpayer shall not be treated as using a 
        normalization method of accounting for purposes of subsections 
        (f)(2) and (i)(9)(C) of section 168 of the Internal Revenue 
        Code of 1986.
