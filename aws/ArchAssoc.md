## Exam Tips:

The main thing for the AWS SAA certification is understanding what the service does. Reading the FAQ for the services and also reading this whitepaper.

Building a LAMP stack on AWS

There are five pillars in the Well Architected Framework there are tradeoffs depending on implementation. 

These are questions asked to know if you are following best practices in AWS. (Recommended reading if going for AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate )

Need ideas or a starting point on build out take a look at our AWS Architecture references.
